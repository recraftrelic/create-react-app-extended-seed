This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then extended to support `react-router`, `redux` and a very simple *folder structure*

## How to use

Clone the project to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/recraftrelic/create-react-app-extended-seed.git
mv create-react-app-extended-seed your-project-name
cd your-project-name
yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
